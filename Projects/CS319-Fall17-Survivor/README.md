# Survivor

### Introduction

We decided to design and implement a game named Survivor that based on reaching destination point in shortest time period. Actually, we are influenced from Mario which was very popular game a long time ago. But we decided to design many different properties from Mario like environmental obstacles.

This report aims to explain and show the game’s elements, rules and requirements. Also, it contains System model.

### Game Overview

The game flow basically goes to finish a racecourse without dying. We will have 4 different environments; Earth, Ocean, Atmosphere and Space. In this case, speed of player will be affected from the environment. The Game’s environments include different obstacles which belong that environments in real life. For example, in space there will be no gravity therefore player should use keyboard more sensitively. Player will have lives that he/she can use for more game. Some obstacles can kill player such as animals in earth. In such a situation player will lose game. Player will have oil tank that will help to go further and if player cannot reload oil tank player will lose the game again.

During game, user can stop the game with pause menu. At the end of environmental part of game, if player finishes up the environment by coming destination point, user will open next environment which is in order like Earth, Ocean, Atmosphere, and Space. User has to be successful in all these environments to finish the game.
