As far as I remember...

I learnt download process of VLFeat Library by http://www.vlfeat.org/install-matlab.html.
From this page, I followed download link: http://www.vlfeat.org/download.html.
I copied archive file to 'D:\MATLAB' and extracted there.
VLFeat must be added to MATLAB search path by running the vl_setup command: run('D:\MATLAB\VLFEATROOT/vl_setup')
Then VLFeat library needed for hw is installed.
