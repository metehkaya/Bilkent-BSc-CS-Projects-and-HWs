# Recomma

Internet allows people to access abundant resources online, and there are various enormous movie collections accessible online. With the increase of available information, a new issue occurs, that is how to select the ones that a particular user is interested in. Recommendation systems seek to determine the ratings or preference of a user based on available data in order to make suggestions. In our project, we tried to identify similar movies based on the content of their scripts, genres and also used movie ratings data and combined our results to make suggestions.
	
To determine similarity between movie scripts we used various methods, including cosine similarity based on tf-idf, jaccard similarity based on genres, kshingling, minhashing, and locality sensitive hashing, word2vec averages and k-means clustering using word2vec vector representations of movie scripts.
	
As our validation method, we used collaborative filtering with interpolation weights, and also SVD with stochastic gradient descent (SGD).

Could not add scripts, movie and rating because of the "size" issue.
